One possible way to create AI with Consciousness

As we approach AGI, which will possess intelligence equivalent to that of humans,
the quest for creating a truly human-like AGI with consciousness arises.
However, creating consciousness seems exceedingly difficult, so perhaps we can
turn to AI for assistance.

To create AI with consciousness, we might consider one approach:

1) Initially, we may utilize various AI tools to develop an AI(Model Analyzer) capable of understanding
other AI models and discerning the relationship between a model's structure and its
functions. This AI should be able to infer some possible model structures that have
the functions of understanding the laws governing our physical world.

2) Subsequently, we can construct an AI(World Analyzer) that can understand our physical world according to the
inferred structures from Model Analyzer. Then, based on World Analyzer, we might be able to create some models
that possess insights into consciousness. They don't need to understand consciousness
very well, but they are supposed to suggest potential avenues for humans to develop
theories of consciousness.

3) Eventually, once our theories are sufficiently robust, they should provide guidance
for us to build something with consciousness.
